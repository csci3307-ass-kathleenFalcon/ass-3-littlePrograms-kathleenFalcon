# Chapter 6

Figure 6.10: This program demonstrates overloaded methods (with the same method name but different arguments).

# Chapter 7

Exp7_HelloArray: This program demonstrates using arrays of primitive and class type, allocating static and dynamic memory to arrays, initializing elements using manual entry, for loops, and foreach loops, and experiments with multi-dimensional arrays.

Exp7_HelloArrayList: This program demonstrates using lists of primitive and class type, allocating dynamic memory to lists, initializing elements using manual entry, for loops, and foreach loops using the list's .add() method.

# Chapter 8

Exp8_HelloConstructor: This program demonstrates the use of a copy constructor with a class Child. It also demonstrates inheritance (extends Parent, GrandParent) and interfaces (implements Asks4money, SpendsMoney, HasName). Java supports single inheritance only but supports multiple interfaces.
